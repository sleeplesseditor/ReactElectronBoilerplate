# React Electron Boilerplate

An investigation for compiling distributable Electron apps using React, as inspired by Kizte's [article](https://medium.com/@kitze/%EF%B8%8F-from-react-to-an-electron-app-ready-for-production-a0468ecb1da3).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
